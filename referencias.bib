@article{Luo2016,
abstract = {People counting in indoor environment is a challenging task due to the coexistence of moving crowds with stationary crowds, recurrent occlusions and complex background information. The performance of existing crowd counting methods drops significantly for indoor scene since the stationary people are missed due to moving foreground segmentation and the counting results are often disturbed by occlusions. To address the above problems, in this paper we propose a counting approach for indoor scenes, which can count not only moving crowds but also stationary crowds efficiently. Firstly, a foreground extraction assisted by detection is introduced for crowd segmentation and noise removal with a feedback update scheme. Then we build a multi-view head-shoulder model for people matching in the foreground and estimate the number of people with an improved K-mean clustering approach. Finally, to reduce the disturbance of occlusions, we present a temporal filter with frame-difference to further refine the counting results. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, a new indoor counting dataset including about 570,000 frames was collected from four different scenarios. Experiments and comparisons show the superiority of the proposed approach.},

@article{Ashton2009,
abstract = {Tags: IT/Infrastructure, Operations Jun 22, 2009—I could be wrong, but I'm fairly sure the phrase "Internet of Things" started life as the title of a presentation I made at Procter {\&} Gamble (P{\&}G) in 1999. Linking the new idea of RFID in P{\&}G's supply chain to the then-red-hot topic of the Internet was more than just a good way to get executive attention. It summed up an important insight—one that 10 years later, after the Internet of Things has become the title of everything from an article in Scientific American to the name of a European Union conference, is still often misunderstood. The fact that I was probably the first person to say "Internet of Things" doesn't give me any right to control how others use the phrase. But what I meant, and still mean, is this: Today computers—and, therefore, the Internet—are almost wholly dependent on human beings for information. Nearly all of the roughly 50 petabytes (a petabyte is 1,024 terabytes) of data available on the Internet were first captured and created by human beings—by typing, pressing a record button, taking a digital picture or scanning a bar code. Conventional diagrams of the Internet include servers and routers and so on, but they leave out the most numerous and important routers of all: people. The problem is, people have limited time, attention and accuracy—all of which means they are not very good at capturing data about things in the real world. And that's a big deal. We're physical, and so is our environment. Our economy, society and survival aren't based on ideas or information—they're based on things. You can't eat bits, burn them to stay warm or put them in your gas tank. Ideas and information are important, but things matter much more. Yet today's information technology is so dependent on data originated by people that our computers know more about ideas than things.},

@article{Evans2011,
abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT), sometimes referred to as the Internet of Objects, will change everything—including ourselves. This may seem like a bold statement, but consider the impact the Internet already has had on education, communication, business, science, government, and humanity. Clearly, the Internet is one of the most important and powerful creations in all of human history. Now consider that IoT represents the next evolution of the Internet, taking a huge leap in its ability to gather, analyze, and distribute data that we can turn into information, knowledge, and, ultimately, wisdom. In this context, IoT becomes immensely important. Already, IoT projects are under way that promise to close the gap between poor and rich, improve distribution of the world's resources to those who need them most, and help us understand our planet so we can be more proactive and less reactive. Even so, several barriers exist that threaten to slow IoT development, including the transition to IPv6, having a common set of standards, and developing energy sources for millions—even billions—of minute sensors. However, as businesses, governments, standards bodies, and academia work together to solve these challenges, IoT will continue to progress. The goal of this paper, therefore, is to educate you in plain and simple terms so you can be well versed in IoT and understand its potential to change everything we know to be true today.},
